This process involves; <ul><li>Trimming whitespaces</li><li>Expanding composite terms like <code>2x</code> into <code>2*x</code></li><li>Varible declarations are extracted, their assigned value or expression executed and stored in the global scope variables dictionary</li><li>Empty lines or statements are ignored</li></ul></li><li>Every statement in the generated list of statements is executed independently. This stage involves the followings; <ul><li>The statement is tokenized to generate a list of identified tokens</li><li>The tokens are then parsed into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) basing on the order of operations and precedence of the operators used.</li><li>The tree is then interpreted by running through the every node identifying the node type and applying the corresponding operation or computation.</li><li>The output of the interpreter is a numerical value.</li></ul></li><li>The resultant value of the last statement is returned with the final state of the global scope.</li></ul>',13),s=[n];function r(l,h,d,c,u,p){return i(),t("div",null,s)}const g=e(o,[["render",r]]);export{f as __pageData,g as default};
